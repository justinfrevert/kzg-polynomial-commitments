KZG PolyCommit$_{DL}$ Construction Re-texified

The used parts of the DL construction, translated to LaTeX for convenience.

Setup($1^κ$, $t$) computes two groups $\mathbb G$, and $\mathbb G_T$ of prime order $p$ (providing $κ$-bit
security) such that there exists a symmetric bilinear pairing $e$ : $\mathbb G$ × $\mathbb G$ →
$\mathbb G_T$ and for which the t-SDH assumption holds. We denote the generated
bilinear pairing group as $\mathcal{G} = 〈e, \mathbb G, \mathbb G_t〉$. Choose a generator $g ∈_R \mathbb G$. Let
$\alpha ∈_R \mathbb Z^∗
_p$ be $SK$, generated by a (possibly distributed) trusted authority.
Setup also generates a $(t + 1)$-tuple $\langle \mathcal{G}, g, g^{\alpha}, \ldots, g^{\alpha^t} \rangle ∈ \mathbb G^t+1$ and outputs
PK = $\langle \mathcal{G}, g^{\alpha}, g\alpha, . . . , g^{\alpha^t} \rangle$
. SK is not required in the rest of the construction.

Commit(PK, $\phi(x)$) computes the commitment $C = g^{\phi(\alpha)} \in \mathbb G$ for polynomial
$\phi(x) \in \mathbb Z_p[X]$ of degree $t$ or less. For $\phi(x) = \Sigma^{deg(\phi)}
_{j=0} \phi_j x^j$, it outputs $C =
\prod^{deg(\phi)}
_{j=0} (g^{\alpha^j}
)^\phi_j$ as the commitment to $\phi(x)$.

CreateWitness($PK, \phi(x), i$) computes $\psi_i(x)$ = $\frac{\phi(x)-\phi(i)}
{(x-i)}$ and outputs $\langle i, \phi(i), w_i \rangle$,
where the witness $w_i = g^{\psi_i(\alpha)}$ is computed in a manner similar to $C$, above.

VerifyEval($PK, C, i, \phi(i), w_i$) verifies that $\phi(i)$ is the evaluation at the index $i$ of the polynomial
committed to by $C$. If $e(C, g) \stackrel{?}{=}  e(w_i, g^\alpha/g^i)e(g, g)^{\phi(i)}$, the algorithm outputs 1, else it outputs
0.
VerifyEval is correct because

$e(w_i, g^\alpha/g^i)e(g, g)\phi(i) = e(g^{\psi_i(\alpha)}, g^{(\alpha-i)})e(g, g)^{\phi(i)}$
$= e(g, g)^{\psi_i(\alpha)(\alpha-i)+\phi(i)}$
$= e(g, g)^{\phi(\alpha)} = e(C, g)$ as $\phi(x) = \psi_i(x)(x-i) + \phi(i)$

Alternative verify eval definition:
$e(\frac {C}{g^{\phi(i)}}, {g}) = e(w_i, \frac{g^\alpha}{g^i})$
